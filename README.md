LostKingdom
===========

Jon Ripley's BrainF Lost Kingdom running in your browser.

I picked up [jquery.terminal](https://github.com/jcubic/jquery.terminal) a copy of the brainfuck program LostKingdom. Then using my nice little BF->asm.js converter I generated a 5MB javascript file and promptly crashed Firefox.

With a bit of bashing and turning off of the "use asm" flag it now seems to work nicely.
